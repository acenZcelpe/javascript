The film follows a group of scientists who experiment with invisibility serum on themselves, but one of them becomes dangerously obsessed with his new power and goes on a killing spree.

Hollow Man was nominated for an Oscar for Best Visual Effects, and won several other awards for its impressive use of computer-generated imagery (CGI) to create the illusion of invisibility.

The film has some interesting trivia behind its production. For example, did you know that an anatomically correct, totally working computer model was created of Kevin Bacon's entire body - down to the last capillary? The 3-D model has since been donated to scientific researchers[^1^]. Or that Kevin Bacon wore skin-tight costumes in different colors to assist with the adding of visual effects[^1^]? Or that Paul Verhoeven was dissatisfied with the film and thought he should not have made it[^1^]?

Hollow Man received mixed reviews from critics who praised the visual effects but criticized the story and characters. The film has a 26% rating on Rotten Tomatoes, based on 118 reviews, with an average score of 4.3/10[^2^]. The consensus reads: \"Despite awesome special effects, Hollow Man falls short of other films directed by Paul Verhoeven. This flick over time degenerates into a typical horror film.\"
 
Some critics compared Hollow Man unfavorably to Verhoeven's previous sci-fi films, such as RoboCop, Total Recall and Starship Troopers, which had more satirical and subversive elements. Roger Ebert gave the film two stars out of four and wrote: \"Does Paul Verhoeven, who directed Hollow Man, have such a low opinion of his audience that he thinks all we want is to see (or not see) the invisible man go berserk?\"[^3^]
 
However, some critics appreciated the film's technical achievements and entertainment value. James Berardinelli gave the film three stars out of four and wrote: \"Hollow Man is a fun summer movie that doesn't demand much from its audience except a willingness to have a good time.\" Kevin Bacon was also praised for his performance as the villainous Sebastian Caine.
